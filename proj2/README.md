This project helps me gain a deeper understanding about risc-V assembly language. I have written about 400~ lines assembly code , which is a definitely painful but enlightening journey.

This project took me about ~6 hours to finish.

The most frequent bug I've encountered is memory bug, especially  loading variable/ptr.

Thanks to UCB for kindly sharing this learning source to usÔºÅ
